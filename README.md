# music-recommendation-app-python

This project is a content-based music recommendation system built in Python.
It recommends songs by analyzing their lyrics using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to measure similarity between tracks.
The app is deployed using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.

Python

🚀 Features

Lyrics-based recommendations for similar songs.

Uses TF-IDF for text vectorization.

Cosine similarity for measuring similarity between songs.

Interactive Streamlit web interface.

Beginner-friendly machine learning project.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x

Pandas – for data manipulation

Scikit-learn – for TF-IDF and similarity calculation

Streamlit – for building the user interface


🧠 How It Works

Load Dataset – Reads the CSV file containing song names and lyrics.

Vectorization – Converts lyrics into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.

Similarity Calculation – Uses cosine similarity to compare songs.

Recommendation Output – Displays top N songs similar to the selected track.


🔮 Future Improvements

Integrate Spotify API for real-time song data.

Add audio features for hybrid recommendations.

Implement collaborative filtering.

Include album art and previews in the UI.
